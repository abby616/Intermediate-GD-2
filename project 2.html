  <div class="smalltext">Well… today sucked, but it could’ve been worse.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">mmmmm no, it couldn’t have.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">I started my morning off on the wrong foot and woke up an hour late for one of my mandatory classes. Ugh, now my grade is going to be even lower than it already is.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">well maybe you shouldn’t stay up til 4 in the morning watching criminal minds, dumbass.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Whatever, anyways, since I was already super late I figured I would skip the rest of that class and treat myself to some coffee before my next class started. So I walk to ABP and get my SCORCHING hot coffee, and then guess what happens?! I SPILL IT ALL OVER MYSELF.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">HA, karma really is a bitch.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Luckily I had enough time to go home and change, but I stained my favorite shirt and I don't know if I’ll be able to get it out:( Anyways, I made it to my next class on-time, thank god.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">LMAO god knows you couldn't have afforded another absence.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">After the rest of my classes that day, my friends and I decided that we would go out that night for our friend's birthday!</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">(Keep in mind- it's February and we had just been hit by a snow storm)</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">We all met up at my friend's house, and started getting ready together. We were blasting our favorite artist while finishing our hair and makeup. </div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">*Mac Miller, obviously*</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Then we moved onto outfits, arguably the most important part of the night.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">no argument there, IT IS the most important part of the night.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">After changing about 2,369,263 times, I finally came up with the PERFECT outfit. I was so excited to show it off.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">a little TOO excited...</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">We're finally all ready to go, and hop in the uber. We get to our friend's birthday party, and have a great time. We were there from about 9-11:30 PM, and decided to leave to get Benny's before it closed.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">well that ended up biting you in your fat ass</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">We get to Benny's and order takeout. As we're leaving we each have two HUGE slices in hand.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">(AGAIN let me remind you- it's February and we had just been hit by a snow storm)</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">The second I step foot outside, I absolutely eat shit. It was as if it happened in slow-mo.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">dramatic ass</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">I slip on black ice and fall straight on my face. For some reason I decided that protecting my pizza was more important than my face???</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">like...where was the logic</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Anyways, as I pick myself up, I feel something crunchy in my mouth...</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">get ready...here it comes...</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Take a wild guess as to what it was...</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">...drumroll please</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">MY TWO FRONT TEETH.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">AHAGHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA</div><br><br><br>

  <img src="img_5529.jpg" class="center"><br><br><br>

  <div class="smalltext">Moral of the story- be careful while walking during the winter.</div><br><br><br>

  <div class="bigtext">You heard it here first, folks.</div><br><br><br>
